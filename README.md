ABOUT THE PROJECT ACCORDING TO RESEARCH PAPERS 
The research paper titled **"Assessing the Impact of Chatbot-Human Personality Congruence on User Behavior: A Chatbot-Based Advising System Case"** explores how the alignment (congruence) between chatbot personalities and human personalities influences user behavior, specifically in the context of an academic advising system. Below is a detailed summary of the paper, which can serve as a foundation for your chatbot app using machine learning:

---

### **Key Focus of the Paper**
The study investigates whether matching chatbot personalities with user personalities affects user trust, engagement, and intention to use the chatbot. It builds on the **similarity-attraction paradigm**, which suggests that people are more likely to trust and engage with others (or agents) who have similar personalities. The research is particularly relevant in the context of academic advising, where chatbots can play a significant role in guiding students.

### **Research Objectives**
1. **Primary Objective**: To examine how chatbot-human personality congruence impacts user behavior in an academic advising context.
2. **Specific Hypotheses**:
   - **H1**: Chatbot-user personality congruence affects users' trust.
   - **H2**: Chatbot-user personality congruence affects users' intended engagement.
   - **H3**: Chatbot-user personality congruence affects users' intention to use the chatbot.

---

### **Methodology**
1. **Chatbot Design**:
   - Three chatbots were designed, each embodying one of the **Big Five personality traits**:
     - **Extraversion**: Chatty, energetic, and assertive.
     - **Agreeableness**: Kind, empathetic, and cooperative.
     - **Conscientiousness**: Thorough, efficient, and detail-oriented.
   - The chatbots used **scripted responses** tailored to their respective personalities.

2. **Experiment Design**:
   - **Participants**: 54 college students interacted with the chatbots.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Participants completed a **Big Five Inventory (BFI)** questionnaire to determine their dominant personality traits.
     - They interacted with all three chatbots in a **counterbalanced order** to avoid bias.
     - After each interaction, participants rated the chatbots on **trust**, **intended engagement**, and **usage intention**.
     - A subset of 18 participants participated in **semi-structured interviews** to provide qualitative insights.

3. **Measures**:
   - **Trust**: Measured using a 10-item scale based on integrity, competence, and benevolence.
   - **Intended Engagement**: Measured by participants' willingness to spend time and repeatedly use the chatbot.
   - **Usage Intention**: Measured by participants' willingness to use the chatbot in the future.

### **Findings**
1. **Extraversion**:
   - **Significant Effect**: Extroverted participants rated the extroverted chatbot higher on trust, engagement, and usage intention compared to other participants.
   - **Reason**: Extroverted participants found the extroverted chatbot more engaging, trustworthy, and unique.

2. **Conscientiousness**:
   - **No Significant Effect**: Conscientious participants did not significantly rate the conscientious chatbot higher on trust, engagement, or usage intention.
   - **Reason**: The conscientious chatbot was perceived as reliable but not significantly more engaging or appealing.

3. **Agreeableness**:
   - **No Significant Effect**: Agreeable participants did not significantly rate the agreeable chatbot higher on trust, engagement, or usage intention.
   - **Reason**: Agreeable chatbots were generally well-liked by all participants, regardless of personality congruence.

4. **Qualitative Insights**:
   - Participants appreciated the **human-like interaction** of the chatbots.
   - Extroverted participants found the extroverted chatbot **exciting and captivating**.
   - Conscientious participants valued the **reliability and clarity** of the conscientious chatbot.

### **Implications**
1. **Designing Chatbots**:
   - Personality-imbued chatbots can enhance user experience, especially for extroverted users.
   - Chatbot designers should consider **user personality traits** when designing conversational agents.

2. **Academic Advising**:
   - Personality-congruent chatbots can improve student engagement and satisfaction in academic advising systems.
   - Institutions should explore the use of personalized chatbots to support students.

3. **Future Research**:
   - Investigate the impact of chatbot-human personality congruence in **other domains** (e.g., healthcare, customer service).
   - Explore the role of **cultural differences** in chatbot interactions.
   - Conduct **longitudinal studies** to assess the long-term effects of personality congruence.

### **Limitations**
1. **Sample Size**: The study involved only 54 participants, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
2. **Context-Specific**: The study focused on academic advising, and the results may not apply to other contexts.
3. **Predefined Tasks**: Participants interacted with the chatbots using predefined tasks, which may not reflect real-world usage.

---

### **Conclusion**
The study found that **chatbot-human personality congruence significantly impacts user behavior, particularly for extroverted users**. However, the effects were less pronounced for conscientious and agreeable users. These findings highlight the importance of designing chatbots with personality traits that align with user preferences, especially in educational settings.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Personality Matters**: Chatbots with aligned personalities can enhance trust, engagement, and usage intention.
2. **Extroversion is Key**: Extroverted users benefit the most from personality-congruent chatbots.
3. **Design Implications**: Chatbot designers should consider user personality traits to create more effective and engaging conversational agents.
